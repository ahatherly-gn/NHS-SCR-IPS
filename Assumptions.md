# Assumptions

 * FHIR R4 will be used as the base FHIR version
 
 * Wherever possible codes should be SNOMED, but for England International Patient Summaries, this will use codes from the full UK SNOMED release and **WILL NOT** be limited to the ["IPS Terminology"](https://www.snomed.org/international-patient-summary-terminology) subset created by SNOMED International for use in international summaries.

 * FHIR Resources included in the IPS bundle **SHOULD** conform to UK Core profiles
