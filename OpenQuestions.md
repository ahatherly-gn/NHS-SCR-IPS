There are a number of open questions and clarifications still to be resolved in relation to this draft specification:

- The Composition in the IPS has a "period" for the document (within the "Event" element) which is marked as "must support". It is not clear how this would be populated, and if implementers would need to analyse all data in the summary to determine the earliest and latest data items to reflect in this period. This would be a high overhead, and it isn't clear whether this is actually required for the NHS SCR Summary.
