# Optional Data Items

The below table provides details of how to populate key items from the urgent care data-set into the International Patient Summary FHIR Bundle

*(this section is agreed)*

This should be any Observations in the record which relate to the existence of other key document such as EPaCCS forms or ReSPECT forms - these actual documents should be separate pointers on NRL, so should not be replicated into this summary document, rather this should indicate their existence so the user can review and retrieve them separately from NRL.

In addition, this section of the summary could contain any other specific key coded observations from those documents, such as ADRT/CPR decisions.
